Speech To Text environment setup has to target Linux, Mac, Windows platforms. 

In case of CUDA GPU availability, we target Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Windows 10 platforms, dedicated mainly for training and development.

According to priorities, first `gpu` subfolder is to be followed.
Then `basic` for Laptops and PC-s without GPU.

TODO: Later we create a reduced version of the above two folders, dedicated for inference only environment.
